# Battleship

Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
*We had a long meeting first where we discussed all the parameters, expectations, and ideas of what the interaction pattern for the game should look like. We used a jamboard to throw out ideas of everything, try to figure out if we needed to break it down even more, and discuss the flow of the project. From there we divided and conquered some of the iteration 3 stuff and started to work asyncronisly. From that point, we did daily checks of what progress was being made, and would hop onto zoom calls if either of us got stuck.*

If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
*Continue to work on the strategy we developed for the computer to intelligently pick/track shots. There is a lot of refactoring that can happen in that class still, however it is working, and there are two classes that were developed. Shane did most of the leg work getting the classes figured out, and then both people took a crack at finishing it off and the approaches are different, yet similar.* 

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
*The first two days of the project we did a lot of driver/navigator coding. But even then when we found spots that we could split, we divided up the work, stayed on a call and worked on the different bits of code seperately. As the project progressed, it became almost entirely asyncronis where we were available to hop on a call, but doing the assigned work seperately.*

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
*Frequent check ins to see where the project was developing, and where each person was on the parts of code that they were working on. If either of us were stuck, we worked together to make sure that we were working with the same idea/planning on using the same variables to help make the merge easier.*
